# Somebody Anybody

I told Mama I'm'a run away to California  
where I think I'll stay  
and if Mama has a problem   
tell her I'll write her every day  

Cause I don't don't know what went wrong  
and I don't know if I'm okay  

So let's run into the mountains  
and let our hair down  
play our music loud  
talk about those things   
that would have made our Papas proud  
until then let's walk around  
get out of this town and walk around  

Cause now I know what went wrong
and now I know that I'm okay

Somebody anybody tell me why  
it's so hard to live before you die  
Somebody anybody tell me why  
Whoa...
