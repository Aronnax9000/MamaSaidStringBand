Kentucky Heartbreak
# by Kaitlen Farmer

You’re smooth like a petal from the roses you picked for me yesterday  
like a first time criminal robbing a bank and getting away  
Takin sugar from a lollipop, or candy from a kid  
stole my heart just like you always did  
Sweet talk won’t help you this time  

Cause you’ve broken my heart so many times  
I can barely breathe  
you’ve left me here all alone in Kentucky  
Well my baby my darling, my honey my sugar  
you know who you are  
Cause there’s just as many of you as there are the stars  

Late afternoon, I’ve got nothing to lose  
I’ve got the ever long lasting pure definition of the heartache blues  
So I’ll take a little walk guess I’ll drink some beer  
and pray to god I find my way out of here  
cause I can’t cope, so piss up rope  

Cause I’ve broken your heart so many times  
why can’t you see  
I left you standing there in misery  
I once was your baby your darling, your honey, your sugar  
that’s few and far  
Cause there’s just as many of me  
as there are the bars
