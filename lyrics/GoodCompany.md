# Good Company

by David O'Neal  

There's a demon on the door step  
and she's callin'  
(callin' callin')  
callin' after me.  

There's a sweet thing  
frightened as she could be  
she looks to us for shelter  
love, good company  

Chorus:  

Who's gonna let her down?  
You with the gun?  
No she ain't  
no she ain't gonna run  

Who's gonna let her down? (Who's gonna do it?)  
You with the gun? (I heard you wouldn't)  
No she ain't  
no she ain't gonna run  

There's a darkness  
in all of you  
inside of me inside of her  
inside of you  

So look  
look with your heart  
give grace a second chance  
a brand new start
