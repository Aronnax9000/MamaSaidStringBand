## Lyrics

My heart's wrapped up in a bow  
It's all that I could afford  
Aren't you getting tired  
Of me never being home  
It's taking its toll  
Being left all alone  
You say that you're fine  
But I can see in your eyes  
Every time I say goodbye  
My hearts wrapped up In a bow  
It's all that I could afford  
Like jewelry it shines,  
yeah I don't mind  
If you wanna leave me behind  
Cause I fall in love all over again  
In every memory I see you in  
Honey I hope you are happy  

Instrumental section 

His letters go unanswered  
And the sky turns grey  
His love starts to fade  
Just like the highway  
Now I'm back at home  
Where I intend to stay  
In solitude for the rest of my days   
My hearts wrapped up in a bow  
It's all that I could afford  
Like jewelry it shines,  
yeah I don't mind  
If you wanna leave me behind   
Cause I fall in love all over again  
In every memory I see you in  
Honey I hope you are happy
