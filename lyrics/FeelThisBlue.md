#Feel this Blue
by Kaitlen Farmer

Did you even look back, I swear I wouldn’t miss
did I even exist, even exist
bidin’ my time you said I wasn’t right for you
I should have known, I should have known that
you could make me feel, feel this blue, my blue baby, my blue baby.

How can you know what to say, while I’m still away
no one to talk, I sleep through the day
Wake up to find that you’ll always be mine
eyes wide open but still blind to why
you could make me feel, feel this blue, my blue baby, my blue baby.

So you take care of yourself, and I’ll try to slow down
Aging of fruit in love makes me drown
Nothin much to do, I’m so used to you
cold and honest but confused to why
you would leave me out, out of the blue, my blue baby, my blue baby
