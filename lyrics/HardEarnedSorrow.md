# Hard Earned Sorrow
B minor, senza capo

I would not deign to possess you  
I just don't want to be ignored  
I could not dare to upset you  
I want you to feel adored  
No tears tonight you're gone tomorrow  
Room and board for hard earned sorrow  

Room and board for hard earned sorrow    
You are precious  
and you are obsessive  
yet you are collected  
No room and board for hard earned sorrow   

Your heart's just simply for now on loan  
just any one's [tears?] borrow  
washed down sinful caress and groan  
tape and box were much more thorough  
No tears tonight you're gone tomorrow  
No room and board for hard earned sorrow  

You are vicious  
and you are posessive  
yet you are elected  
No room and board for hard earned sorrow  

No tears tonight you're gone tomorrow
