# Cold Dark Sea
```
I don't care if it never stops raining  
not if you that you'll ever stop complaining  
grass is surely greener  
when we make believe  
pack your cabinets full of lies  
about way things used to be  

And all those things seem so ?? of the day  
don't have to paint the picture if i decide to stay  
truth of the matter is that I just can't let go  
love like yours comes only once  
and I'm afraid of the cold  

Pack up all your memories  
throw them out into  
out into the cold dark sea  
so when those waves come crashing on the shore  
you don't have to think of me  
think of me no more  
no more  
pack your cabinets full of lies  
about the way things used to be  

Write it in your journal  
or write it in your past  
just make sure these feelings  
never have to last  
"You're prettier when you smile"  
that's what he said to me  
little do they know  
how the story always goes  

Pack up all your memories  
throw them out into  
out into the cold dark sea  
so when those waves come crashing on the shore  
you don't have to think  
think of me no more  
no more  

```
