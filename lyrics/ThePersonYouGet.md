# The Person You Get  
by Kaitlen Famer

Nothing gets easier and more things don't make sense  
I try to give you my love and I get the short end of the stick  
and I hate myself when I'm around you  
cause I don't know who that person is  

Cause the person you met  
and the person you get  
is the same as opposite  
as opposite could get  
so I'll cancel my plans for tomorrow  
and probably the day that follows  

Well what good's it to even try  
when all I'm waiting for is vic'try day to die  
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't care  
so don't call me out, don't you dare  

Well I'm known for telling white lies it's true (that's true)  
Like the time you asked, well I love you, do you?  
I said of course I do  
Stop your worrying and sleep tonight  
just kiss me and sleep goodnight.
