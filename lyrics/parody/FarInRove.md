# Far in Rove (Fall in Love)
Alan Canon

It's rice wrapped up with some roe
that's all that I could afford

Aren't you getting tired
getting takeout on the phone?
It's taking its toll
on your Chime card, and my loan

My Goldfish thinks you're suss and so do I
When you say Sushi, and I'll buy

Botulism free, with little Mercury
This batch came from Germany
