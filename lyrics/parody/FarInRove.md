# Far in Rove ([Fall in Love](../FallInLove.md))
Alan Canon

It's rice wrapped up with some roe  
that's all that I could afford  

Aren't you getting tired  
getting takeout on the phone?  
It's taking its toll  
on your Chime card, and my loan  

My Goldfish thinks you're suss   
and so do I  
When you say Sushi,  
and I'll buy  

It's seaweed wrapped, with some roe
that's all that I can afford

Botulism free, with little Mercury
This batch came from Germany 

Cause Far in Rove's the only place
we could get that shit for miles

And Far in Rove's my ex's house
the memory don't make me smile
