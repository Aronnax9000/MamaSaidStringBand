# Seasons of Change
by David O'Neal

Misery is heartache at rest  
a weary heart cannot guess  
not til they find their way into my arms  
not til they find their way home  

Giving up all you know  
You will not reap what you have sown  
You’ve laid bare the fields of gold  
Dear harvest is burned,  
Burned, burned to the ground  

Rest up feel easy  
lay your head on my shoulder  
morning is yet to come  
c’mon come back home  

Seasons of change are comin’  
The weather for once is changin’  
There’s a warm wind blowing in  
c’mon come back home  

Rest up feel easy  
lay your head on my shoulder  
morning is yet to come  
c’mon come back home
